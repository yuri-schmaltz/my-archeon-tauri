☯️ Archeon 3D 2.0 is an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system for generating high-resolution textured 3D assets.

The system includes the following foundation components:

1. [Archeon 3D-DiT](): a large-scale shape generation model.
2. [Archeon 3D-Paint](): a large-scale texture synthesis model.
3. [Archeon 3D-Studio](): a versatile, user-friendly production platform that simplifies the re-creation process of 3D
   assets. It allows both professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes efficiently.
4. [FlashVDM](): a universal acceleration framework.
