## **Abstract**

We present Archeon 3D 2.0, an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system for generating high-resolution textured 3D assets.
This system includes two foundation components: a large-scale shape generation model - Archeon 3D-DiT, and a large-scale
texture synthesis model - Archeon 3D-Paint.
The shape generative model, built on a scalable flow-based diffusion transformer, aims to create geometry that properly
aligns with a given condition image, laying a solid foundation for downstream applications.
The texture synthesis model, benefiting from strong geometric and diffusion priors, produces high-resolution and vibrant
texture maps for either generated or hand-crafted meshes.
Furthermore, we build Archeon 3D-Studio - a versatile, user-friendly production platform that simplifies the re-creation
process of 3D assets. It allows both professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes
efficiently.
We systematically evaluate our models, showing that Archeon 3D 2.0 outperforms previous state-of-the-art models,
including the open-source models and closed-source models in geometry details, condition alignment, texture quality, and
e.t.c.

## ☯️ **Archeon 3D 2.0**

### Architecture

Archeon 3D 2.0 features a two-stage generation pipeline, starting with the creation of a bare mesh, followed by the
synthesis of a texture map for that mesh. This strategy is effective for decoupling the difficulties of shape and
texture generation and also provides flexibility for texturing either generated or handcrafted meshes.

### Performance

We have evaluated Archeon 3D 2.0 with other open-source as well as close-source 3d-generation methods.
The numerical results indicate that Archeon 3D 2.0 surpasses all baselines in the quality of generated textured 3D assets
and the condition following ability.

## 🤗 Get Started with Archeon 3D 2.0

Archeon 3D 2.0 supports MacOS, Windows, Linux. You may follow the next steps to use Archeon 3D 2.0 via:

- [Code](#code-usage)
- [Gradio App](#gradio-app)
- [Linux Native Build](#linux-native-build)
- [API Server](#api-server)

- [Docker Usage](docs/DOCKER.md)
- [Blender Addon](#blender-addon)
- [Official Site](#official-site)

### Install Requirements

Please install Pytorch via the [official](https://pytorch.org/) site. Then install the other requirements via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

#### Texture Generation Extensions
```bash
# for texture
cd hy3dgen/texgen/custom_rasterizer
python3 setup.py install
cd ../../..
cd hy3dgen/texgen/differentiable_renderer
python3 setup.py install
```


### Code Usage

We designed a diffusers-like API to use our shape generation model - Archeon 3D-DiT and texture synthesis model -
Archeon 3D-Paint.

You could assess **Archeon 3D-DiT** via:

```python
from hy3dgen.shapegen import Archeon 3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline

pipeline = Archeon 3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline.from_pretrained('tencent/Hunyuan3D-2')
mesh = pipeline(image='path/to/your/image.png')[0]
```

The output mesh is a [trimesh object](https://trimesh.org/trimesh.html), which you could save to glb/obj (or other format) file.
### Gradio App

You can now launch a single unified app and select the model (Normal, Multiview) directly from the UI:

```bash
```bash
# Safe default (loads models on demand, opens browser automatically)
# Safe default (loads models on demand, opens browser automatically)
python3 my_hunyuan_3d.py
```

#### New Pro Features (v2.0)
- **Unified Interface**: Full-screen, responsive layout with optimized density and "Pixel-Perfect" fit.
- **Stop Generation**: Immediately cancel generation tasks with the Red Stop Button.
- **Smart Tabs**: Auto-switching prompts based on model category (Multi-view/Normal).
- **Progress Feedback**: Granular, thread-safe progress bars.


### Linux Native Build

You can build a standalone executable for Linux (Ubuntu/Fedora/Arch) using our included build scripts:

```bash
# Build the standalone binary (dist/Archeon3D/Archeon3D)
bash build_scripts/build_linux.sh

# Install desktop shortcut (optional)
cp build_scripts/Archeon3D.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
```
- **Session Persistence**: Automatically saves your last used settings (Seed, Steps, Guidance) so you can pick up where you left off.
- **Linux Native**: Full support for Linux AppImage and native builds with `.desktop` integration.



### API Server

You could launch an API server locally, which you could post web request for Image/Text to 3D, Texturing existing mesh, and e.t.c.

```bash
# Default port changed to 8081 for better coexistence
python my_hunyuan_3d.py --api --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8081
```

#### Features
- **Security**: Basic Auth enabled (Default: `admin` / `admin`). Configure via `API_USERNAME` and `API_PASSWORD` env vars.
- **Diagnostics**: `/health` endpoint for connection and worker status.
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics available at `/metrics`.

#### Usage Example

A demo post request for image to 3D using basic authentication:

```bash
img_b64_str=$(base64 -w 0 your_image.png)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8081/generate" \
     -u admin:admin \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "image": "'"$img_b64_str"'",
           "texture": false,
           "model": "Normal"
         }' \
     -o output.glb
```

### Blender Addon

With an API server launched, you can use our **Archeon 3D-2 Pro (v1.3)** addon for a seamless 3D workflow inside Blender.

- **Download**: [scripts/blender_addon.py](scripts/blender_addon.py)
- **Compatibility**: Fully compatible with **Blender 5.0** and earlier versions.
- **Pro Features**:
  - **Connection Diagnostics**: Test API reachability directly from the panel.
  - **Smart Context**: Automatically switches between *Generation* and *Texturing* based on object selection.
  - **Transform Sync**: Inherit position/rotation/scale from existing scene objects.
  - **Auto-Organization**: Collections for keeping your workspace clean.
